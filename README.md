# Spin Operator

The Spin Operator enables deploying Spin applications to Kubernetes. It watches [SpinApp Custom Resources](https://github.com/spinkube/documentation/blob/main/content/en/docs/spin-operator/reference/custom-resource-definition.md) and realizes the desired state in the Kubernetes cluster. This project was built using the Kubebuilder framework and contains a Spin App CRD and controller.
