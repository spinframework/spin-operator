# Spin Operator

The Spin Operator enables deploying Spin applications to Kubernetes. It watches [SpinApp Custom Resources](https://github.com/spinkube/documentation/blob/main/content/en/docs/spin-operator/reference/custom-resource-definition.md) and realizes the desired state in the Kubernetes cluster. This project was built using the Kubebuilder framework and contains a Spin App CRD and controller. 

## Documentation

To learn more about the Spin Operator and the SpinKube organization, please visit [the official Spin Operator documentation](https://github.com/spinkube/documentation/tree/main/content/en/docs/spin-operator) which is housed inside the [the official SpinKube documentation](https://github.com/spinkube/documentation/tree/main/content/en/docs).


At this point in the preview, we recommend testing Spin Operator on a local k3d cluster via `make install`. The [quickstart guide](https://github.com/spinkube/documentation/blob/main/content/en/docs/spin-operator/quickstart/_index.md) will walk you through prequisites and the installation workflow.

> > Spin Operator installation via Helm chart for remote clusters while in private preview is WIP and can tracked [here](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/issues/54). In the meantime, please use the guidance from our quickstart guide.
